# My movie list

## Overview

All your  favorite movies in on place. You can find
what you need here plus you can quickly search, find and even store your newest movies.

## Usage
Each 'movie card' has a delete button that removes  the movie from the page. A search bar is provided to help you find a particular movie by name as well as a way to add a new movie 
on your list by navigating to the "Add Movie" page.
